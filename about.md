Hi! I'm Michelle. I became interested in tech after taking a class in high school called Digital Electronics. In the class, I wrote programs that instructed LED lights to display a series of numbers. Since, I've had a desire to pursue degrees in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering.

### More Information
As of now, I leisure by reading "The Mosquito: A Human History of Our Deadliest Predator", scouring Facebook's marketplace for discounted board games, and lifting weights.
