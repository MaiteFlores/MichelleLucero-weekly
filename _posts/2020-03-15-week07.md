Open Source is Not About You

I haven't been in the FOSS scene for too long so I have yet to see the sense of entitlement in FOSS as described by Rich. Nevertheless, I have to agree with Rich. As new contributor to FOSS, I don't have the right to dictate a FOSS project as I desire. I do have the right to suggest my desires and/or contribute my desire. Furthermore, my contributions don't have to be accepted as it may not fit with the vision of the FOSS project.
