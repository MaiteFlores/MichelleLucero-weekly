**What skills do I have that would be useful for contributing to a FOSS project?**

Technical Skills
1. I have a familiarity with programming languages such as python, C++, javascript, HTML, and CSS.
2. I have a basic understanding of algorithms and data structures such as hashing, searching, and sorting.

Non-technical Skills
1. I have the desire to always keep learning.
2. I'm a good team member as I keep myself accountable for my part and help other members if they're struggling.

**What things are the most interesting to me? I.e., what do I enjoy doing?**

Technical Interests
1. I look for ways to improve user experience in web and app applications. For example, I noticed that my local animal shelter's website for adoptions did not have the best user experience. As a personal project, I want to develop a smoother adoption process at my local animal shelter.
2. Improving my data structure skills. I'm currently practicing using data structures outside of a classroom setting.

Non-technical Interests
1. I love spending time with my dog Charlie.
2. I enjoy reading genres such as sci-fi, science, history, and fantasy.
3. I enjoy playing FPS games.
4. I like to learn unusual and useless facts. 
For example:
Fidel Castro had an obsession with dairy.
