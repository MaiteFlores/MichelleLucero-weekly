Part 1: "Irrupt" Change
---
I, like my peers and professors, walked into school on Wednesday, March 11 not knowing it would be our last day. It seems as if whoever was in charge of notifying Hunter College's switch to remote learning did a poor job in doing so, considering many staff members and students found out through a tweet from CUNY's twitter account. Both professors and students had many questions, that were left unanswered with "I don't know"s. In retrospect, perhaps switching to remote learning wasn't as irrupt as it seemed, as many colleges including other CUNYs, switched days prior. Nevertheless, it was an unsettling day, which has yet to seem real to me. We said our goodbyes as for some of us it would be the last time we would be seeing one another. I, at least have 1 or 2 semesters left at Hunter but for others this is their last semester of college and from here they're thrown into the "real world". 

Part 2: Separating (Home)work from Home
---
Being at school reminds me that there's always work to be done. However, being at home changes my attitude to "there's so much time", that it creates an illusion of justified leisuring. This is an attitude I hope to change by associating my desk as a place of work and scheduling time for work. I'll start implementing this routine in the following week. Besides my work ethic and social deprivation, remote sessions have gone surprisingly well. For Open Source, I had no issues connecting to the session via Blackboard Collaboration, and was able to easily follow the lecture. For Symbolic Logic, I appreciate that my professor posted his lectures on Youtube as it allows me to rewatch his lectures and watch the lectures in times 2 speed. Futhermore, I appreciate the camoes from my professor's pets and childrens in lectures, it makes them more relatable. Albeit, the stream of emails can be overwhelming and the thought of missing just one is daunting.
