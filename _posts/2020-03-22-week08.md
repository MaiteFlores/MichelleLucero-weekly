Part 1: "Irrupt" Change
---
I, like my peers and professors, walked into school on Wednesday, March 11 not knowing it would be our last day. It seems as if whoever was in charge of notifying Hunter College's switch to remote learning did a poor job in doing so, considering many staff members and students found out through a tweet from CUNY's twitter account. Both professors and students had many questions, that were left unanswered with "I don't know"s. In retrospect, perhaps switching to remote learning wasn't as irrupt as it seemed, as many colleges including other CUNYs, switched days prior. Nevertheless, it was an unsettling day, which has yet to seem real to me. We said our goodbyes as for some of us it would be the last time we would be seeing one another. I, at least have 1 or 2 semesters left at Hunter but for others this is their last semester of college and this is how they're thrown into the "real world".
