# Ways I'd like to Contribute to FOSS
  - **Being a Software critic:**
  I consider myself to be somewhat film critic (no snubness intended), by this I mean the typical comments people make **AFTER** the end of   a film. I have the ability to praise and critic where I see warrants it. Sadly, my critics go unheard. Thus, I look forward to using 
  my critic abilities to use for once--in FOSS. I have no power to change anything in a film, but I'll have the ability to make               change in FOSS.
  - **Editing Documentation:**
  I know I'm not the first nor the last to be guilty of not looking at the their projects for over 48 hours, and then having the misfortune   of not understanding anything they wrote. All the pain, time, and shame wasted on understanding your own program could have been           prevented if you kept proper documentation. Anyways, documenting FOSS may help me properly document my own.
