**List of OSS I found Interesting**
 - [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=readme&type=&language=)
 
 For the past two months, I've been interested in computer vision and thought what better way to learn about computer vision then by contributing to OpenCV. Capitivated by the software's ability to apply to self driving cars, I was disappointed to discover that the code of conduct file was no where to be seen. Therefore, I had to eliminate this as an option.
 
 - [Umbrella](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android)
 
 Umbrella's purpose is to protect aid workers, journalists, and activists by managing their security both physically and digitally. Intrigued by the cause, I looked into its github and found that Umbrella was not only missing files, it also had few issues and not much activity going on. I had to elminate this due to inactivity and missing essential files such as the code of conduct.
 
 - [Open Data Kit](https://github.com/opendatakit)
 
 Open Data Kit(ODK) makes collecting data in resource-constrained environments easier. According to its [website](http://opendatakit.org/), it monitors "rainforests to observing elections to tracking outbreaks". Fortunately, ODK has all four files: contributing, readme, license, and code of conduct. ODK's issue tracker has a good amount of "good first issue", which are good for newcomers. Therefore, ODK remains an option.
