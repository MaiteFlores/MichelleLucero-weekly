In all the tech events I have attended, I have not failed to hear the words "open source". I'll admit, every now and then I would do a quick google search, click on one of first three links, read the contents from that link for 3 seconds, and unfortunately I'd forget about it until the next tech event. So why am I here? I've decided to end what perhaps would have been an infinite loop (ignore the condition upon my death). Taking this course will end my repetitive behavior by finally enlightening me to the ways of open source software. So far, I'm not disappointed in my decision. In fact, I'm excited! I feel that open source software will allow me to take on software that I believed were intimidating to even build. Perhaps now I'll be one of those people uttering the words "open source" in my next tech event.
