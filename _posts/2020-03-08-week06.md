OSS Contributions

Contributing to OpenStreetMap every week has made me realize that I'm not aware of my surroundings. After 25 contributions to OpenSteetMap, I was having a tough time thinking of new contributions to make. This week I decided to take pictures of areas I pass by, which allowed me to contribute details of a block on avenue X in Brooklyn. Besides those contributions, I edited a classmate's blog by fixing minor spelling mistakes, which I believe were due to fast typing.
