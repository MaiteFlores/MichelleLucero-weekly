Initially, my teammates and I chose Teammates to be the open source project we would work on in the course of this sememster. Upon further inspection, we realized we would have trouble contributing to the project as it required knowledge of technologies that some of us were not familiar with such as Servlet, Angular, and Google App Engine. Thus our search continued, we created a google docs to share OSS projects we were interested in and created mini project evaulations to aid us in our decision making process. Ultimately, we were drawn to Next.js for its plentiful "Good First Issues", supportive and active community. 

OSS Contributions

Contributing to OpenStreetMap every week has made me realize that I'm not aware of my surroundings. After 25 contributions to OpenSteetMap, I was having a tough time thinking of new contributions to make. This week I decided to take pictures of areas I pass by, which allowed me to contribute details of a block on avenue X in Brooklyn. Besides those contributions, I edited a classmate's blog by fixing minor spelling mistakes, which I believe were due to fast typing.
